# Android Intern Project: Build Your Own App

Ready to flex your Android skills? Welcome to the Android Intern Project! This is your chance to create something awesome and show us what youâ€™ve got. Below, youâ€™ll find everything you need to get startedâ€”requirements, steps, and how weâ€™ll check out your work.

## Project Overview
In this project, youâ€™ll dream up and build an Android app from scratch. Weâ€™re not handing you a blueprintâ€”this is all about your vision. Whether you want to fix something that bugs you, entertain the world, or test a crazy idea, youâ€™re in the driverâ€™s seat. The catch? It needs to be a working app that taps into core Android powersâ€”like slick UI, smart storage, or networking magic. Weâ€™ll use this to see how you think, code, and bring ideas to lifeâ€”key traits weâ€™re looking for in our next intern.

## Requirements
1. **App Idea:** Unleash your imaginationâ€”craft an Android app that tackles a real-world annoyance, delivers a burst of fun, or dives into something wild and experimental! Need a nudge? Think along the lines of a clever task-juggling tool, a quirky mini-game to kill boredom, or a weather wizard that surprises with flair. Your idea, your rulesâ€”just wow us!  

2. **Technical Specs:**  
- Language: Kotlin.  
- Minimum SDK: API 26 (Android 8.0).  
- Must follow Clean Architecture principles (e.g., separate presentation, domain, and data layers).  
- Must include at least 3 modern Android features (e.g., Jetpack Compose for UI, Coroutines with Flow for async work, Room for storage, Koin for dependency injection, App Startup for initialization, Navigation Compose, or choose your own) or build all if you want to go all in.  
 
3. **Deliverables:**  
   - **Source code (full project folder)** - *Mandatory* âœ…: Include all files needed to build your app.  
   - **A working APK file** - *Mandatory* âœ…: A compiled APK we can install and test.  
   - **A video demo** - *Mandatory* âœ…: A short video showcasing all the flows of your app.  
   - **A short README file** - *Optional*: 1-2 paragraphs covering:  
     - What your app does.  
     - How you built it (e.g., tools, libraries, challenges).  
     - What are the limitations of the application.  
     - Whatâ€™s your next milestone for the application. 

## How Your Code Will Be Evaluated
Weâ€™ll review your submission based on these criteria:  
- **Functionality (30%):** Does the app work as intended? Is the idea clear and usable?  
- **Android Skills (30%):** Are Android components (e.g., lifecycle, UI, data handling) used correctly and effectively?  
- **Code Quality (20%):** Is the code clean, readable, and well-organized? Are there comments or logical structure?  
- **Creativity & Effort (20%):** How unique or interesting is your idea? Did you add polish (e.g., UI design, extra features)?  

**Bonus Tips (Not Mandatory):**  
- Add **unit tests** (e.g., with JUnit 5) for brownie points ðŸŽ‰â€”show us your codeâ€™s reliability!  
- Use **Kotlin Multiplatform** to push boundaries to new heights ðŸš€â€”share code across platforms and blow us away!

Weâ€™ll run your APK on an emulator or device and inspect your code in Android Studio. Make sure it builds without errors!

## Steps to Complete the Project
Follow these instructions to fork, build, and submit your app:

### 1. Fork the Repository
- Click the **Fork** button at the top-right of this GitHub page. This creates a copy of this repo under your GitHub account.  
- Youâ€™ll work in your forked repo: `https://github.com/your-username/buildYourOwnApp`.

### 2. Set Up Your Project
- **Clone the repo:** On your computer, run:  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/buildYourOwnApp.git
  ```
- Open Android Studio:  
  - Create a new Android project inside the cloned folder (File > New > New Project).  
  - Use your chosen app name and package (e.g., `com.yourname.myapp`).  
- Build your app based on your idea, following the requirements above.

### 3. Add Your Files
- Replace this README with your own README explaining your app.  
- Add your project files (source code) to the repo folder.  
- Generate an APK: In Android Studio, go to Build > Generate App Bundles or APKs > Generate APK, then upload it to your Google Drive and share the link ðŸ“Ž with us.
- Record a video demo: Capture a short video showcasing all your appâ€™s flows, then either include a link to it in your README or upload it to your Google Drive and share the link ðŸ“Ž with us.

### 4. Commit and Push Your Work
- Stage your changes:  
  ```
  git add .
  ```
- Commit your work:  
  ```
  git commit -m "Submit my Android app project"
  ```
- Push to your forked repo:  
  ```
  git push origin main
  ```

### 5. Submit Your Project
- Send us the link to your forked repo (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/buildYourOwnApp`) via email to shantanu.das@rapido.bike.  
- Ensure your repo is public so we can review it.

## Tips for Success
- Start simpleâ€”focus on a working app, then add extras if time allows.  
- Test your APK on an emulator or device before submitting.  
- Use comments in your code to explain tricky parts.  
- Leverage AI tools at your convenience to speed up your process and showcase your AI skills.  
- Stuck? Google, Stack Overflow, and Android docs (developer.android.com) are your friends!
