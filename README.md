## How We Built It üõ†Ô∏è  
### Tech Stack & Libraries  
- **Kotlin Multiplatform**: Shared business logic across Android/iOS.  
- **Jetpack Compose**: Declarative UI for Android.  
- **Koin**: Dependency injection to manage components.  
- **Grok AI**: Speech-to-text transcription for voice entries.  
- **Ktor Client**: Networking for API calls to Grok AI.  

### Challenges  
- Real-time audio transcription requires an active internet connection.  
- Manual mood selection limits dynamic AI-driven insights.  

---

## Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è  
1. **Online-Only Transcription**: Voice entries cannot be processed offline.  
2. **Static Mood Options**: Users must select moods from a predefined list instead of AI-generated suggestions.  

---

## Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è  
### Next Milestones  
1. **AI-Powered Mood Analysis**:  
   - Integrate **Grok AI** to auto-detect mood from voice/text entries weekly/monthly.  
2. **Visual Analytics**:  
   - Add charts/graphs to visualize mood trends and energy levels over time.  
3. **Personalized Suggestions**:  
   - Generate recommendations (e.g., meditation, workout) based on AI-derived mood scores.  
4. **Memory Summaries**:  
   - Create concise summaries of journal entries for selected time periods.
